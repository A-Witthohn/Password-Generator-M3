The Purpose of this Activity is to create a password generator that meets all the acceptance criteria listed below for the module 3 assignment in the UNC Full Stack Bootcamp. Using logic created in the script.js file. The user will be prompted to provide a password length after clicking the button (Generate Password). If the parameters for length are not met the user will be asked to adjust their length. Once a proper length is given the user will be prompted for four character types (Uppercase, Lowercase, Numbers, and Special Characters).
